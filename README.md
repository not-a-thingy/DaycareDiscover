Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, finding the perfect child care solution for your little ones can be a daunting task. Our Daycare Application addresses the specific needs of parents and child care providers by offering a user-friendly platform. This application streamlines the daycare selection process, making it easier for parents to find the ideal child care facility and allowing child care providers to showcase their services effectively.

Problem Statement
Every day, parents face the crucial challenge of selecting a daycare facility that aligns with their unique requirements. Existing options often lack comprehensive information, making the decision-making process overwhelming. Our solution is designed to streamline this process, making it easier for parents to find the ideal child care facility while offering child care providers a platform to showcase their services.

Competitor
In the realm of child care applications, "Anak2U" stands as a notable competitor. Our Daycare Application aims to surpass competitors by providing a more comprehensive suite of features, improved communication channels, and enhanced user experience.

Feasibility Study
A thorough feasibility study has been conducted, indicating a high possibility of successfully completing the project. Market research, a capable development team, and partnerships with child care agencies contribute to our confidence in delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly daycare application.

Objectives
To guide our development journey, we've outlined the following objectives:

Analyze Requirements from Parents and Child Care Agencies:

Actively engage with parents and child care agencies to understand their unique needs and preferences.
Design the Proposed Daycare Application:

Craft a well-thought-out design for the application, encompassing user interfaces, robust database structures, and efficient communication features.
Implement and Test the Daycare Application:

Meticulously implement the application, subjecting it to rigorous testing to meet high-performance, security, and usability standards.
By addressing the problem, conducting a thorough feasibility study, and outlining clear objectives, we are poised to develop and deliver the Daycare Application successfully.

1.2 Proposed System
In our proposed Daycare Application, a set of functional and non-functional requirements will shape the system's development. Functionally, the platform will enable user registration for parents and childcare providers, facilitate viewing daycare listings, and allow users to access comprehensive details about daycare facilities, schedule visits, and contact providers directly through the app. Admins will possess the capacity to verify listings, resolve content-related disputes, and monitor user engagement.

Non-functional Requirements
The application will emphasize a user-friendly interface, security, performance, scalability, reliability, usability, and compliance with data protection regulations.
